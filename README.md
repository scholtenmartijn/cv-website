# Martijn's CV Website

Welcome to my humble attempt at taming the wild beast that is React and Next.js. Yes, this is my official dive into the world of modern web development after taking a multiple year break from it. Brace yourself.

## Getting Started

To witness this grand experiment in action, start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev (if you're feeling adventurous)
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and be amazed (or not, no pressure).

Feel free to start editing `app/page.tsx`—just be aware that it auto-updates, so you can’t hide your mistakes for long!

## Deploy on Vercel

Deploying this masterpiece is easiest on the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme). Because why not let the creators of Next.js host your Next.js app?

Enjoy the ride, and may your code be bug-free (or at least entertaining)!
